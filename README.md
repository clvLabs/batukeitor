## Motivation
Main facts:
* Batucada is fun.
* There's a lot of songs.
* It's sometimes difficult to remember all of them, with their different variations.
* Newer students can take longer to catch up if they can only _learn by playing_.
* Students training to become directors need to memorize the sequences of the sections in each score, and (ideally) what each instrument is playing in each section.
* [Music notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_notation) has helped us since long ago, we could give it a try.
* Music scores are perfect... but not everybody knows how to read them.

With these in mind I tried to find a software solution to have a way to share scores with my batucada crew ([btu-K](https://btu-kvallirana.cat) forever!!! ❤️❤️❤️) but nothing seemed to fit.

So... hands on the keyboard!

What I wanted to achieve:
* Keep all of my crew's scores together in one place.
* Be able to keep our kid's scores in a separate place for them.
* Super-easy entry level for users.
  * No need to install anything.
  * Available from any device, from anywhere.
  * Able to play the audio of what you see, in order to better understand it.
* As-easy-as-can-be entry level for administrators/maintainers.
  * No need for complicated installations and dependencies (pure HTML/css/js).
  * Easy-to-write score files.
  * Easy-to-mantain crew packs.

So far I think `Batukeitor` can fill this gaps for my crew, and maybe for yours too... enjoy it!
