## Local server
If you are going to write/edit scores, it's always better/faster to edit files locally, test them until you're happy with the changes and then upload the scores to your web host using `FTP`.

Or maybe you just want to play with it for a while and you don't have or don't want to use your web hosting... whatever.

To have a local web server to test the app locally, you either need:
* Using [Python](https://www.python.org) - Here [a sample article](https://realpython.com/python-http-server) explaining how to do it.
* [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org)
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php)
* ... or any other you may find looking for **_my_operating_system_ local web server** on your search engine of choice.
